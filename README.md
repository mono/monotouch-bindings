monotouch-bindings
==================

This module contains MonoMac and MonoTouch API bindings for popular 
iOS or MacOS libraries that developers can reuse on their own 
applications.

If you would like to get your binding added, contact us.

To build MonoTouch bindings:

	To build, run `make' on the toplevel directory to build all
	iOS, or if you only want to build a specific module run `make'
	on the specific directory.

To build OSX bindings:

	Run `make osx' at the toplevel directory, or go into the
	specific directory and run `make osx'
