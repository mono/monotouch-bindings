# StatusBar
A minimal status bar for iOS. It covers the top status bar and appears like the message is embedded within. StatusBar is available in the [Xamarin Component Store](http://components.xamarin.com/) as a free component download.

## Installation
### Binding
**Note**: This is not the recommended approach. Unless you are updating the binding manually and trying to test it out, I would recommend using the StatusBar component. It has a much more seamless integration into your application

1. Optional: Re-download KGStatusBar from Kevin Gibbons. Remove KGStatusBar.h/.m from the Static Library Xcode project and add the new versions. Build the static library and reference it in the binding project.
2. Build the binding.
3. Reference the .dll built in your project.

### Component
1. Open up the "Components" folder of the project you are wishing to add StatusBar to.
2. Browse for StatusBar in the Component Store.
3. Click "Add to App". The component will be downloaded and all references will be setup for you.

## Usage
There is a sample available with the component, though you can easily get the sample to work with the binding by referencing the .dll instead of adding the component.

Prior to Use: Add a using directive to the top of the class you are wishing to use StatusBar for.
    using KGStatusBar;

Usage:
    StatusBar.ShowStatus ("Status message!");
    StatusBar.ShowError ("Error message!");
		StatusBar.ShowSuccess ("Success message!");
    StatusBar.Dismiss ();

## Credits
StatusBar is the Xamarin.iOS-capable version of [KGStatusBar](https://github.com/kevingibbon/KGStatusBar) from Kevin Gibbon of [Attachments.me](https://attachments.me/). Kevin certainly deserves all the credit as all I have done is create the Xamarin.iOS binding for the library.
