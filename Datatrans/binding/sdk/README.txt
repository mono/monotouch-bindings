Datatrans payment libraries allow direct handling of the payment process within an app (in-app purchasing),
i.e. without having to go through the corresponding app store. This solution is unique in that the client
does not need to leave the app during the payment process. The front-end GUI can be adapted to the 
requirements of individual shops, and every step in the process includes sophisticated retry and 
roll-back functions designed to prevent erroneous transactions, for example in the event of poor 
network coverage.
