========

These are bindings to the native Facebook SDK for iOS, currently we bind version 4.4.0.

Using
=====

Copy the Facebook.dll project in the binding directory to your
project, and add it as a reference in your project.

Building
========

Run `make' in the binding directory to build Facebook.dll. It only creates the ios unified dll. If you want to create the classic dll, you need to modify the binding project.

Sample
======

The sample program in sample/ is a partial port of Facebook's Samples
program, it covers about half of the features in it.
