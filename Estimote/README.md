Estimote Beacons Xamarin SDK wrapper
=======================

A wrapper around the Estimote iOS SDK ( https://github.com/Estimote/iOS-SDK ).

Estimote Beacons are small, wireless sensors from http://estimote.com that use a new Bluetooth low energy (BLE) chip and continually transmit radio signals that your phone can pick up.
You can think about the beacon as a small lighthouse tower that's installed in a fixed location and broadcasts its presence to all the ships (smartphones) around.
The nearby smartphones can communicate with them using an API theyâ€™ve developed. This makes it easy for developers to add micro-location features to their mobile apps.

For the technical specifications of the Estimote beacons see http://estimote.com/api/index.html

- **UPDATE** 2013-11-22 Created a working demo based on the Proximity demo from Estimote: https://github.com/Estimote/iOS-SDK

- I will appreciate all input, feedback, and especially contributions!

This is my personal project, I'm not affiliated with Estimote in any way.

Building
=======
The Estimote-iOS binding requires Xamarin.iOS 7.0+ to build.

Credits
=======
Xamarin-EstimoteBeacons is the Xamarin.iOS-capable version of [EstimoteSDK](https://github.com/Estimote/iOS-SDK/tree/master/EstimoteSDK).
Estimote certainly deserves all the credit as all I have done is create the Xamarin.iOS binding for the library.
